Applied Data Science Capstone Project

This repository contains files that have been used to complete the final assignment of the Applied Data Science Capstone course. This course is the last course of the IBM Data Science Professional specialization on Coursera.

The code can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) while the .csv file contains the data that was the foundation of the project.

The .bat file is there for convenience. If you associate it (in Windows) with .ipynb files then it opens the Jupyter Notebook app automatically. For this to work on your machine you need to change the path within it to point to your Jupyter Notebook or Anaconda directory.
